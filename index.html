			<p>
				I decided to get back into school and do this coding boot camp because of changes going on at work and a recent need for more developers. I look forward to learning more and becoming more competant with coding.

				I am married with 3 children, one daughter and two sons. I love the outdoors especially hiking and kayaking. My favorite thing to do at home is play board games with my family and friends.
